      <p>
        The American Dewey family traces its origins to <strong>Thomas Dewey, known as ‘The Settler’</strong>, born in England in the early seventeenth century.
        Parish records place his baptism in <strong>Dorset, England</strong>, reflecting the family’s roots in southwestern England.
        In the context of the <strong>Puritan Great Migration</strong>, Thomas left England and arrived in <strong>Massachusetts Bay Colony</strong> by <strong>1630</strong>, part of the wave of English settlers seeking religious stability and opportunity in New England.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thomas Dewey is documented in Dorchester, Massachusetts, where he became a freeman in <strong>1634</strong>, signaling full civic standing in the colony.
        Soon after, he joined other settlers moving west and established himself in <strong>Windsor, Connecticut</strong>, one of the earliest English settlements in the Connecticut River Valley.
        There, he married Frances Clark and raised a family whose descendants spread throughout New England.
        Thomas died in <strong>1648</strong>, but his children carried the Dewey name forward, anchoring it firmly in early American history.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this single immigrant ancestor descends an unbroken American line spanning nearly four centuries.
        Among the most prominent descendants is <strong>Admiral George Dewey (1837–1917)</strong>, whose victory at the <strong>Battle of Manila Bay</strong> during the <strong>Spanish–American War</strong> marked the emergence of the United States as a global naval power.
        He remains the only person in U.S. history to hold the rank <strong>Admiral of the Navy</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another notable descendant is <strong>Thomas Edmund Dewey (1902–1971)</strong>, a nationally influential figure in twentieth-century America.
        As a crime-fighting prosecutor, <strong>three-term Governor of New York</strong>, and <strong>Republican presidential nominee</strong> in 1944 and 1948, he shaped modern American politics and governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This lineage continues through my mother, a Dewey, and to me, a Dewey and an American, linking present identity directly to early colonial settlement, national service, and enduring public leadership.
